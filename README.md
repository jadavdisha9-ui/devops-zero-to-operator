# DevOps Zero to Operator

## Who I am
I come from a non-engineering background and I am training myself to become a DevOps operator.

## Why DevOps
I like understanding how systems work, why they fail, and how to fix them instead of just writing code.

## How I am training
I am focusing on Linux fundamentals, system behavior, failures, debugging, and real-world thinking instead of shortcuts or tools.
